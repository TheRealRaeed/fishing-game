# Project Overview
As part of one of my chapters, I learned Java Classes and how to use them. This game was a submitted assignment where I made a fishing game to demonstrate my understanding of classes. 

## Die Class
The die class contains the underlying functions and tools to randomly select a number that the switch statement executes
